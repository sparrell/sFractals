sFractals examples dir
=====

The "examples" directory contains several example erlang scripts to create some simple fractals. The differences between the examples (eg resoultion, time to run,...) are explaing below.

Times
-----

For calibration purposes, 
here are the unscientifically measured run times for the various examples 
(eg so you'll not freak if when example 7 takes much longer.

1. Example 1 = 1s
2. Example 2 = 13s
3. Example 3 = 25s
4. Example 4 = 27s
5. Example 5 = 25s
6. Example 6 = 1s
7. Example 7 = 70s
8. Example 8 = wip
9. Example 9 = wip

Example 1
-----

A really simple Julian fractal. The configuration is in example1.ecfg. It is only 10 pixels by 10 pixels with a depth of 11 (ie 11 colors)
